# Compose Examples
I will take one container that is defined in Docker compose format (YAML) and then go from a simple install, to slowing buling the complexity. 

The idea here, is to show how simple it is to deploy a functioning container in Docker Compose. But, also to show how we can add value through the use of other containers and features in Compose.
